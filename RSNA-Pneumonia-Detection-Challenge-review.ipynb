    "- Model : Retinanet(much simpler, but similar outcome compared to Faster-RCNN like models or SSD) with se-resnext101(it worked the best, se-resnext50 slightly worse)\n",

    "- Anchor size modification : Instead of using the mean output of anchor sizes, I used value at 20 percentile and reduced it even more proportionally to difference between 80 and 20 percentile between models."
